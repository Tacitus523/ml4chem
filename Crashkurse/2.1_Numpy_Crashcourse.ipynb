    "### Numpy Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy is a Python library for scientific computing with powerful tools for manipulating multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- A lot of (most) python packages use numpy functionality.\n",
    "- Numpy performs the matrix manipulations internally using highly optimized C-code, which is often orders of magnitude faster than any implementation that one could write in pure python.\n",
    "  - Therefore, you should always think about how you can use numpy functionality and functions to replace your slow python for-loops etc.\n",
    "- If you use python for scientific purposes, there is no way around numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go through some basic numpy functionality, but we cannot cover everything. For more advanced features, you can visit the [Numpy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) or you can also ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to rewrite some of your code using fast numpy features ðŸ˜ƒ."

    "### Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "One crucial and very powerful feature of numpy is broadcasting. This enables numpy to smartly change the shape of an array to make arithmetic operations between differently shaped arrays possible, as long as they are \"broadcastable\" into each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding or multiplying two arrays, they usually need to have the same shape to be able to apply the operation element-wise. Broadcasting allows operations such as addition or multiplication between arrays of different shapes, by duplicating (\"broadcasting\") the smaller array to match the larger array. This often makes it possible to vectorize array operations so that no slow python loops are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When operating on two arrays with different shapes, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing (i.e., rightmost) dimension and works its way left. Two dimensions are compatible if they are equal, or one of them is 1. If they are equal, then the dimensions are directly compatible and the operation can be performed element-wise as usual. If one of the dimensions is 1, then the array is duplicated along that dimension to match the size of that dimension of the other array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the arrays do not need to have the same number of dimensions (length of the shapes do not have to be the same). If one of the arrays has a smaller number of dimensions, the missing dimensions are filled with \"dummy\" dimensions of size 1 from the left.\n",
