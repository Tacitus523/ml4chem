    "\n",
    "- Numpy is a Python library for scientific computing with powerful tools for manipulating multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- A lot of (most) python packages use numpy functionality.\n",
    "- Numpy performs the matrix manipulations internally using highly optimized C-code, which is often orders of magnitude faster than any implementation that one could write in pure python.\n",
    "  - Therefore, you should always think about how you can use numpy functionality and functions to replace your slow python for-loops etc.\n",
    "- If you use python for scientific purposes, there is no way around numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go through some basic numpy functionality, but we cannot cover everything. For more advanced features, you can visit the [Numpy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) or you can also ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to rewrite some of your code using fast numpy features ðŸ˜ƒ."
