As we haven't dealed with this so far, I will provide you with a solution for this problem using the Tensorflow ImageDataGenerator, which will provide a constant stream of images as we need them. Some of the data handling might be different for this generator, but this will be pointed out. This also provides us with some handy tools to generate data from data, as we can manipulate the training-images by zooming, rotating and moving it up and down, which will make the model more transferable and work against overfitting."
